# Data handling and safety

- Never commit real personal or sensitive address data.
- Use sanitised fixtures and the parquet files in `example_data/` for reproduction/tests.
- Keep example/debug outputs free of personal data.
- When adding fixtures, keep them minimal but representative of UK address edge cases.
- Document any new fixture purpose in nearby tests or comments.
- Preserve expected input schemas for matching pipelines (for example `unique_id`, `address_concat`, and `postcode` where required).
- If schema assumptions change, update dependent tests and examples in the same change.
